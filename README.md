# REAML2022-hackathon

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Konnsy/REAML2022-hackathon/wiki) for information about the hackathon. 


## Example Solutions

As announced during the hackathon, you can now find example solutions for the first two tasks in the [example solutions wiki page](https://github.com/Konnsy/REAML2022-hackathon/wiki/Example-Solutions).
The solutions are based on the code frames that were given beforehand and contain the added code iself, a decription of what was changed or added, the result scores , and also trained models enabling a test run without having to train before a first test.

The given implementations are just examples of what can be used and are no optimal solutions. You are welcome to use these as a starting point for improvements and to develop completely new solutions.
Since the main event is over, the absence of hard time constraints will certainly allow you to come up with additional ideas.

## Updates
In the data sections of the tasks you can now find two downloadable archives: one containing the raw data as provided in the main event and one containing the already preprocessed files that were generated with a window size of 100. You can use those to save time (avoiding the additional calculation on the fly) or just for your own visualization.

**IMPORTANT FOR TASK 2**: Be aware that the window size of 100 must also be matched in the particles dataset by giving the window size of 100 as input (standard is 60)!


## Feel free to contact us
We are always happy to exchange interesting approaches and to discuss the detection of particles with you. You can also create an issue or contact us directly when you encounter problems with the given code or data.
