# REAML2022-hackathon

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/Konnsy/REAML2022-hackathon/wiki) for information about the hackathon. 


## Example Solutions

As announced during the hackathon, you can now find example solutions for the first two tasks in the [example solutions wiki page](https://github.com/Konnsy/REAML2022-hackathon/wiki/Example-Solutions).
The solutions are based on the code frames that were given beforehand and contain the added code iself, a decription of what was changed or added, the result scores , and also trained models enabling a test run without having to train before a first test.

The given implementations are just examples of what can be used and are no optimal solutions. You are welcome to use these as a starting point for improvements and to develop completely new solutions.
Since the main event is over, the absence of hard time constraints will certainly allow you to come up with additional ideas.

## Feel free to contact us
We are always happy to exchange interesting approaches and to discuss the detection of particles with you. You can also create an issue or contact us directly when you encounter problems with the given code or data.
